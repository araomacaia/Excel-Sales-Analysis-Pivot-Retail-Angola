### 🔍 Business Insights Extracted

1. **Revenue Concentration by Department**  
   Logistics and Sales together account for over 65% of total revenue, indicating that operational efficiency and sales execution are the primary revenue drivers, while Finance and IT play more of a supporting role.

2. **Geographic Revenue Concentration**  
   Luanda contributes nearly two-thirds of total revenue, highlighting strong market dominance but also presenting both an opportunity for scale and a risk due to limited regional diversification.

3. **Profit Margin Consistency**  
   Profit margins remain consistently around 22–23% across departments and regions, suggesting that revenue differences are driven more by sales volume than by pricing or cost efficiency variations.

4. **Client Concentration Risk**  
   Revenue is highly concentrated among a small group of top clients, indicating strong key-account performance but exposing the business to potential client dependency risk.

5. **Temporal & Payment Behavior Insights**  
   Interactive filtering by payment method and year reveals shifts in sales patterns over time, enabling deeper analysis of cash flow behavior and payment preferences.
